# You're an Eventing Master

that are displayed in the browser. Most interaction with web sites
does not happen through Chrome tools, obviously, so now we will be
learning how to utilize the JavaScript that was written in the previous
section inside of functions. We will show you have to take the same
behavior that was implemented directly in the browser, but have it
fire off by an event listener, as in a realistic application.
